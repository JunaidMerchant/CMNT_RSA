DeconvolveReml_AllSubsArray.sh - script for running 3dDeconvolve and REMLfit to create subject-level GLM on fMRI data

ExtractTmapsAndMerge4Rsa_AllSubsArray.sh - once modeling is complete, this script separates out the tmaps to prepare it for use with CosmoMVPA toolbox

Supplemental_DeconvolveReml_AccurateTrials_AllSubsArray.sh - script for running 3dDeconvolve and REMLfit to create subject-level GLM using only the accurate trials. This required slightly different modeling approach that involves combining all runs into one.

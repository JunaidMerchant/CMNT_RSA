# File Details for g_roi_socialbrain/

GetCieling_newST.m - Function for getting noise cieling of an ROI

GetCielingsSB_Loop_MskScl.m - Function for getting noise cieling of an ROI

RepConn_Clustering.R - R script used for visualizing and calculating the representational connectivity clustering analysis

SocialBrainRepConnEucMskScl.m - script for getting the ROI data from each social brain ROIs, calculating euclidean distance and saving to .mat files

remove_zero_cosmo_ds.m - this is a function I created to handle missing data from voxels. The recommended workflow for the CosmoMVPA toolbox actually ends up covering up the missing data, which can be problematic for ROIs near the edge of the brain (like the ATL we are interested in)
